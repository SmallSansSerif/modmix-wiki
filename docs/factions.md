## Spawners: How They Work
- **Natural spawners** (found in world structures) **do not drop** when mined or exploded.
- **Player-placed or shop-bought spawners** **do drop** and **can be mined** (no Silk Touch required).
- In **enemy-claimed land**, you **cannot** mine spawners with a pickaxe. Use **creeper eggs** or **TNT**.
- **Exploded stacks** drop **one spawner**, not the entire stack.

## Raiding & Cannoning (Basics)
- TNT settings (live server): **Spread: NONE**, **Flow: OFF**, **Parity: ON**.
- No glitching, duping, or exploit-based entry.
- Cannons are allowed; use the Cannoning Server to test long-range shots and timings.
- See the full [Raiding & Cannoning Guide](raiding.md).

## Ranks (Cosmetic, Earned In-Game)
- Progress with `/rankup` after meeting:
  - Required **mcMMO Power**
  - Required **in-game currency**
  - **30 XP levels**
- Ranks: **VIP**, **VIP+**, **MVP**, **MVP+**, **MVP++** (purely cosmetic; no gameplay advantage).

## FAQs (OG Factions)
**Do I need Silk Touch for spawners?**  
No. Player-placed/shop spawners are mineable without Silk Touch. Natural spawners never drop.

**How do I test cannons?**  
Use `/server cannon` or the **Cannoneer NPC** at spawn to access the Cannoning Server (creative plots).

**Are there restrictions on raiding?**  
Play fair: no glitching or exploits. TNT and creeper eggs are allowed as tools for raiding.
