# General FAQ

## Is MODMIX pay-to-win?
**No.** All ranks (ranks only in OG Factions) are cosmetic and **earned in-game** via `/rankup`. Requirements include mcMMO power, in-game currency, and 30 XP levels.

## How do I report bugs or issues?
Use the **#support** channel in our Discord: [discord.gg/6BMT3mfnfs](https://discord.gg/6BMT3mfnfs)

## Where can I test cannons safely?
Use `/server cannon` or the **Cannoneer NPC** at spawn to reach the Cannoning Server (creative plots). It mirrors live TNT behavior (Spread: none, Flow: off, Parity: on).

## Do natural spawners drop when mined?
No. Natural spawners never drop. Player-placed or shop-bought spawners do drop and can be mined without Silk Touch.

## Are there rules against exploits?
Yes. Exploits, dupes, and glitch entry are prohibited across the network. Play fair.
