# Raiding & Cannoning Guide

## Cannoning Server (Testing)
- **Access:** `/server cannon` or talk to the **Cannoneer NPC** at spawn.
- **Mode:** Creative plots dedicated to cannon testing.
- **Version:** Sora 1.21.8 (Paper/Purpur/Sakura fork).
- **Settings (test parity with live):**
  - TNT Spread: **NONE**
  - TNT Flow: **OFF**
  - TNT Parity: **ON**

These settings are designed to **mirror live raiding behavior**, so your timing and sand stacks behave consistently.

## Live Server Notes (OG Factions)
- **Natural spawners** never drop; **player-placed/shop** spawners do.
- In enemy land, use **creeper eggs or TNT** to break spawners; stacks drop **one**.
- No glitching or exploit-based entry. Play fair and strategic.

## Helpful (Allowed) Player Mods
- **Litematica** — Plan builds and cannon layouts. **No printer.**
- **Replay Mod** — Record raids for review and content.
- Lightweight **HUD / status** mods — Armor, durability, coords.

> Tip: Test **long-range** sand stackers on the Cannoning Server to validate TNT timing at distances before committing on live.

## Basic Raiding Flow
1. **Scout** — Map borders, identify weak points, water placement, and claim layout.
2. **Stage** — Gather TNT, sand, creeper eggs, and supplies near target.
3. **Build** — Assemble cannon; confirm chunk alignment and world border proximity.
4. **Test** — Fire with reduced TNT to confirm tick timing and sand behavior.
5. **Breach** — Increase to raid charge, monitor stack height and wall regen (if any).
6. **Secure** — Control access, disable defenses, loot efficiently.
